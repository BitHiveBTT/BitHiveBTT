# BTT Business Model

## Introduction: Redefining Healthcare Economics

The BTT business model represents a fundamental restructuring of healthcare economics, particularly in the healthcare sector. By leveraging the powerful combination of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and decentralized physical infrastructure, BTT creates a sustainable economic framework that aligns the interests of all participants while addressing key efficiency issues in traditional healthcare service and financing models.

At its core, BTT transforms five key healthcare challenges into opportunities:

* High costs and inefficient utilization of advanced AI computing resources
* Insufficient liquidity of valuable medical assets and infrastructure
* Misaligned economic incentives for preventive care
* Friction and inefficiency in healthcare payments
* Fragmentation of patient data across healthcare providers

By integrating DePIN hardware dividends, RWA tokenization, healthcare incentive systems, and streamlined payment solutions, BTT creates a circular economy that allows value to flow freely between participants while ensuring beneficial behaviors are appropriately rewarded throughout the ecosystem.

## Core Value Propositions

BTT's business model delivers unique but complementary value to each participant group in the healthcare ecosystem, creating powerful network effects that strengthen as the platform grows.

### For Healthcare Providers

BTT significantly reduces the cost of advanced AI diagnostic systems by transforming capital expenditure from a fixed cost to a usage-based variable expense. This enables even small to mid-sized clinics to access cutting-edge AI capabilities without the burden of substantial upfront investment. Additionally, BTT's tokenization framework allows these providers to unlock liquidity from traditionally illiquid assets (equipment, properties, intellectual property, and service rights), creating new capital formation opportunities without traditional financing constraints.

### For Computational Contributors

BTT transforms excess computational capacity into productive assets capable of generating sustained returns. Individual contributors can deploy home-scale DePIN hardware devices to earn BTT tokens based on their computational contributions, while larger institutional contributors can allocate substantial resources to support more complex healthcare AI applications. This distributed computing network creates a true sharing economy for healthcare AI resources, optimizing utilization and reducing waste throughout the system.

### For Patients

BTT fundamentally transforms the economic experience of healthcare through three complementary mechanisms. First, the incentive system rewards preventive care behaviors, treatment adherence, and healthy lifestyle choices by providing BTT points with real economic value. Second, the PayFi payment network reduces transaction costs and accelerates settlement times, making healthcare more financially convenient. Third, the tokenization of medical assets enables patients to participate in fractional ownership of healthcare infrastructure, creating investment opportunities previously limited to institutional investors.

### For the Broader Healthcare Ecosystem

BTT's business model drives substantive efficiency improvements by creating price discovery mechanisms for computational resources, establishing valuation frameworks for tokenized medical assets, and reducing friction in payment processes. These efficiency gains translate directly into reduced costs and improved accessibility throughout the healthcare system.

## Revenue Streams and Economic Model

BTT's business model integrates multiple complementary revenue streams that collectively ensure sustainable economic growth while delivering value to all ecosystem participants. This multifaceted approach differentiates BTT from narrower blockchain healthcare initiatives and provides resilience against market fluctuations in any single revenue category.

### Computational Resource Marketplace

The BTT computational marketplace operates on a consumption-based model where healthcare providers pay for AI computational resources based on actual usage. The pricing structure incorporates multiple variables, including computational intensity, urgency, data volume, and specialized hardware requirements. This consumption-based model typically saves healthcare providers 60-80% compared to maintaining dedicated AI infrastructure or using centralized cloud providers.

From the generated revenue, approximately 70% is allocated to computational contributors in proportion to resource supply, 15% is directed to the BTT development fund for ongoing platform improvements, 10% goes to the BTT Foundation to support ecosystem expansion, and 5% is retained as operational reserves. This allocation ensures that the majority of value flows directly to those providing the infrastructure while maintaining resources for ongoing ecosystem development.

Since deployment, the computational marketplace has shown strong growth, with monthly transaction volumes increasing from 5 million RMB in early 2025 to over 35 million RMB in Q2 2025. Current projections anticipate this volume exceeding 100 million RMB monthly by the end of 2026 as more healthcare providers integrate BTT's AI capabilities into their diagnostic workflows.

### Asset Tokenization Platform

The asset tokenization platform generates revenue through a multi-tiered fee structure that balances accessibility with sustainability. Initial tokenization of medical assets incurs a one-time minting fee ranging from 1-3% based on asset complexity, regulatory requirements, and valuation needs. Secondary market transactions on the BTT exchange generate transaction fees of 0.5-1.0%, significantly lower than the traditional 3-7% fees typically associated with medical asset transfers.

Additional revenue sources include periodic revaluation services for tokenized assets (0.25-0.5% of asset value), enhanced liquidity pool management for institutional token holders (1-2% annual management fee), and premium listing services for high-value medical assets seeking broader investor visibility.

The asset tokenization platform has facilitated over 200 million RMB in tokenized medical assets during its initial six months, with projections exceeding 1 billion RMB by mid-2026 as more healthcare providers recognize the capital efficiency improvements offered by tokenization.

### Patient Incentive and Reward System

The patient incentive system integrates multiple revenue mechanisms that align economic incentives with improved health outcomes. Healthcare providers pay subscription fees ranging from 3,000-25,000 RMB monthly depending on clinic size to access the complete BTT patient engagement platform, which has demonstrated 22-35% improvements in patient retention for participating clinics.

Commercial partners offering health-related products and services pay arrangement and redemption fees when patients use their BTT points within their ecosystem, creating a robust commercial network that enhances the utility of earned points. Insurance providers increasingly offer premium discounts for patients demonstrating continued engagement with the BTT health incentive system, with a portion of the realized savings flowing back into the BTT ecosystem.

Data from the first two quarters of operation shows an average 27% increase in preventive care visits and a 31% improvement in treatment plan completion rates for participating clinics, directly translating into improved clinical economics and patient outcomes.

### PayFi Payment Network

The PayFi payment network generates revenue through a streamlined fee structure that is significantly lower than traditional healthcare payment processing fees while offering enhanced capabilities. Standard transaction fees range from 0.5-0.8% compared to industry averages of 2.5-3.5%, with healthcare providers receiving payment within 1-2 hours rather than traditional 2-5 day settlement periods.

Additional revenue sources include international payment currency conversion fees (0.75% compared to traditional 3-4%), enhanced payment analytics and reporting capabilities (0.25%), and premium listing services for high-value medical assets seeking broader investor visibility (0.5%).

The payment network currently processes over 30 million RMB in medical transactions monthly, with month-over-month growth averaging 12% as more providers adopt the system for the combined advantages of lower fees and accelerated settlement.

The following table summarizes BTT's diversified revenue streams and their relative contribution to ecosystem economic sustainability:

This program has proven particularly effective, with 45% of new institutional acquisitions currently generated through healthcare peer referrals rather than direct marketing efforts.

## Token Economics and Resource Allocation

The BTT token serves as the fundamental unit of value exchange within the ecosystem, designed with careful consideration of economic incentives, regulatory compliance, and sustainable growth. The token economic model balances the interests of all stakeholder groups while creating mechanisms for long-term ecosystem development and stability.

### Token Utility and Value Drivers

The BTT token integrates multiple utility functions that drive intrinsic value through actual ecosystem usage rather than speculative interest. Primary utility functions include:

Computational resource payment for AI services, with healthcare providers using BTT to access diagnostic and analytical capabilities through the decentralized network. This creates continuous token liquidity, with providers purchasing tokens to gain service access while computational contributors receive tokens for providing resources.

Governance participation rights that enable token holders to influence ecosystem development decisions, technical standards, and resource allocation priorities. This utility becomes increasingly valuable as the ecosystem matures and governance progressively decentralizes according to established timelines.

Staking mechanisms for network security and prioritization, where token holders can stake BTT to receive priority service levels, reduced fees, or enhanced features across various ecosystem components. This creates token demand from active ecosystem participants while reducing circulating supply.

Reward distribution for beneficial behaviors, including computational resource provision, patient health activities, ecosystem development contributions, and community governance participation. These reward mechanisms align economic incentives with activities that enhance the overall ecosystem value.

Payment settlement through the PayFi network across the healthcare value chain, enabling near-instantaneous transaction settlement with minimized fees compared to traditional payment channels. This utility creates natural token demand proportionate to payment volume within the ecosystem.

### Token Allocation Structure

The total supply of BTT tokens is fixed at 21 million tokens, with an allocation structure carefully designed to support institutional stability while ensuring sufficient tokens for network operations and community development.

| Allocation Category | Percentage | Tokens (millions) | Vesting Schedule | Purpose |

This allocation structure ensures tokens are distributed to ecosystem participants based on value creation rather than speculation. The substantial mining reward pool (30%) recognizes the critical importance of computational infrastructure to ecosystem functionality, while balanced allocations to founding institutions (10%) and strategic investors (9% combined) provide necessary support while preventing token over-concentration.

### DePIN Hardware Dividend Economics and Sustainability

The BTT DePIN hardware dividend model distinguishes itself from traditional cryptocurrency mining by focusing on useful computation that delivers direct healthcare value. This approach transforms computation from a pure consensus mechanism to a productive activity with tangible benefits beyond token generation.

DePIN hardware dividends are allocated according to a multi-variable formula that incorporates:

- Computational resources contributed (GPU capacity, specialized AI accelerators)
- Uptime and reliability metrics (continuous service availability)
- Quality of service parameters (low latency, high throughput)
- Geographic distribution factors (rewarding deployments in underserved regions)
- Energy efficiency indicators (incentivizing sustainable operations)

This comprehensive approach ensures that mining activities align with the ecosystem's core mission of improving healthcare accessibility and efficiency. Unlike traditional crypto mining that often consumes substantial energy to create artificial scarcity, BTT DePIN hardware directs computational resources to real-world healthcare applications with direct clinical impact.

The DePIN hardware dividend economics are intentionally designed to accommodate participants of various scales, from individual contributors with modest equipment to institutional operators with sophisticated infrastructure. Initial data shows positive economic returns across all scales:

- Home-scale miners (1-5 GPUs): 8-14% monthly return on investment
- Medium-scale operators (6-50 GPUs): 12-18% monthly return on investment
- Institutional infrastructure (50+ GPUs): 15-22% monthly return on investment

These economics ensure broad participation while creating natural market mechanisms for optimizing resource allocation. As the network grows, these returns will normalize through market competition, but the fundamental value proposition of directing computational resources to healthcare AI applications ensures ongoing economic viability beyond the initial adoption phase.

### Sustainable Growth Mechanisms

Beyond the initial token allocation, BTT integrates multiple mechanisms to ensure long-term ecosystem growth and stability:

A portion of transaction fees across all ecosystem components is directed to the BTT development fund, creating a sustainable funding source for ongoing technical improvements, security audits, and infrastructure enhancements. This mechanism ensures development resources scale proportionally with ecosystem activity.

Token burning from certain high-value transactions (particularly on the asset tokenization platform) gradually reduces the total supply over time, creating deflationary pressure that benefits long-term ecosystem participants as adoption increases.

Staking incentive mechanisms encourage token holders to lock up tokens for extended periods in exchange for enhanced ecosystem benefits, reducing circulating supply while aligning participant interests with the long-term health of the ecosystem. These staking mechanisms include governance weight multipliers, fee discounts, and priority service access.

Governance-controlled treasuries provide flexibility to address emerging needs or opportunities without requiring additional token issuance. These treasuries are initially managed by the foundation with a progressive transition to community governance according to established decentralization timelines.

Collectively, these mechanisms create a self-sustaining economic model that balances current operational needs with long-term growth requirements, ensuring the BTT ecosystem can continue to expand its healthcare impact while maintaining economic stability for all participants.
