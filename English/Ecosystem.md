## Ecosystem Value Flow

The BTT ecosystem has constructed a circular economic system that enables continuous value flow among participants through four complementary mechanisms, creating sustainable economic value while enhancing the healthcare experience.

### Computational Resource Marketplace

At the core of BTT's technical architecture is a sophisticated computational resource marketplace that ingeniously connects healthcare AI computational demands with decentralized computational supply. The marketplace operates with a smooth workflow where mining rig operators contribute GPU and AI-specific accelerator resources to the network, forming a vast computational pool. BTT's intelligent resource allocation algorithm schedules computational tasks based on urgency, complexity, and resource availability, ensuring optimal utilization of network resources.

Contributors receive BTT tokens as rewards based on their computational contributions, online time, and service quality, establishing economic incentives for participation and high-quality service provision. On the demand side, healthcare service providers call upon these resources as needed to run AI services such as diagnostic image analysis, treatment planning, and patient risk assessment, without having to build expensive dedicated infrastructure themselves.

This market architecture addresses the core inefficiency in traditional computing models—the misalignment of computational resource supply and demand across time and geography. Through its dynamic responsive market mechanism, BTT allocates resources on demand, maximizing value while reducing waste and optimizing healthcare service delivery efficiency.

### Asset Tokenization Platform

BTT's asset tokenization trading platform represents a breakthrough innovation in healthcare financing, enabling unprecedented liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. Healthcare service providers can register physical equipment, properties, service rights, or intellectual property to the BTT ecosystem, which undergo compliance and technical standard reviews before being tokenized.

After approval, digital tokens representing partial ownership or usage rights are generated, reflecting their true market value and future expected returns based on transparent valuation models. These tokens can circulate on BTT's compliant trading platform, allowing healthcare service providers to access capital without completely disposing of assets, while opening up previously inaccessible healthcare infrastructure investment opportunities to investors.

The trading platform currently facilitates approximately 50 million RMB in tokenized asset transactions monthly, projected to grow tenfold to approximately 500 million yuan in monthly transactions by 2027, demonstrating the enormous potential of the medical asset tokenization market.

### Health Incentive System

The BTT health incentive system directly links positive health behaviors with actual economic rewards, fundamentally reshaping the incentive structure for "prevention-first" healthcare. Patients record their health-promoting behaviors through authorized health applications and connected devices integrated with the BTT platform, including regular check-ups, medication adherence, and lifestyle improvements.

Each activity requires verification through trusted data sources, including professional service confirmations, IoT device data, or trusted oracle channels. After verification, the system allocates BTT points through an intelligent algorithm based on health value, potential impact, and execution quality.

These points have real economic value and can be used to exchange for medical services, health products, or directly converted into BTT tokens for broader economic circulation.

System data shows that patients participating in this incentive system have a 39% increase in preventive treatment compliance and a 29% increase in treatment plan completion rates, resulting in better health outcomes and lower long-term medical costs, benefiting all ecosystem participants.

### PayFi Payment Network

BTT's PayFi payment network serves as a critical bridge connecting the digital ecosystem with the physical healthcare economy, spanning the entire payment lifecycle while reducing friction and costs. Users can access the system through various methods including digital wallets, physical BTT cards, or mobile QR code payments.

A major feature of this network is its powerful cross-border payment capability with extremely low transaction fees, particularly suitable for medical institutions operating across regions or international patients seeking specialized medical care. As more medical institutions support BTT payments, a virtuous cycle forms between user expectations and merchant adoption.

Most critically, BTT PayFi enables almost instantaneous fund settlement, significantly faster than the 2-5 day clearing cycle required by traditional healthcare payment systems. This mechanism improves the cash flow situation for medical institutions while eliminating payment uncertainty for patients. Currently, the network processes over 30 million RMB in medical transactions monthly, with adoption rates accelerating as network effects strengthen.
